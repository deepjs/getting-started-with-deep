# Playing with html and data

So now that you saw the deep.View() way to make a dynamic html page, we will focus on deep.stores (effective way to get access to data via deep protocols) and how to use them in your development workflow (from dummies data to real RESTful service). We will also introduce the "HTMLenhancers" that boost your html and keep it simple.

## deep.stores and their associated protocols










//store collection : dummies data
//list enhancer
//schema
//autobahn Restful service : memory...mongo?
//replacing dummies data with real data from the service
